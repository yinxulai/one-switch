# Messages

## Create a Message

**POST** `/v1/messages`

Send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, and the model will generate the next message in the conversation.

The Messages API can be used for either single queries or stateless multi-turn conversations.

Learn more about the Messages API in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/get-started)

### Headers

- `"anthropic-user-profile-id": optional string`

  The user profile ID to attribute this request to. Use when acting on behalf of a party other than your organization. Requires the `user-profiles` beta header.

- `"anthropic-workspace-id": optional string`

### Body parameters

- `max_tokens: number`

  The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

  Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

  Set to `0` to populate the [prompt cache](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#pre-warming-the-cache) without generating a response.

  Different models have different maximum values for this parameter.  See [models](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) for details.

  minimum: 0

- `messages: array of MessageParam`

  Input messages.

  Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

  Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

  If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

  Example with a single `user` message:

  ```json
  [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
  ```

  Example with multiple conversational turns:

  ```json
  [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
  ]
  ```

  Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

  ```json
  [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
  ]
  ```

  Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

  ```json
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
  ```

  ```json
  {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
  ```

  See [input examples](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages).

  Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#give-claude-a-role), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

  There is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request.

              Always equals the contents of `content[start_block_index:end_block_index]` joined together. The text block is the minimal citable unit; this field is never a substring of a single block. Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

              Exclusive 0-based end index of the cited block range in the source's `content` array.

              Always greater than `start_block_index`; a single-block citation has `end_block_index = start_block_index + 1`.

            - `start_block_index: number`

              0-based index of the first cited block in the source's `content` array.

          - `CitationSearchResultLocationParam object`

            - `type: "search_result_location"`

            - `cited_text: string`

              The full text of the cited block range, concatenated.

              Always equals the contents of `content[start_block_index:end_block_index]` joined together. The text block is the minimal citable unit; this field is never a substring of a single block. Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

            - `end_block_index: number`

              Exclusive 0-based end index of the cited block range in the source's `content` array.

              Always greater than `start_block_index`; a single-block citation has `end_block_index = start_block_index + 1`.

            - `search_result_index: number`

              0-based index of the cited search result among all `search_result` content blocks in the request, in the order they appear across messages and tool results.

              Counted separately from `document_index`; server-side web search results are not included in this count.

              minimum: 0

            - `source: string`

            - `start_block_index: number`

      - `ImageBlockParam object`

        - `type: "image"`

        - `source: Base64ImageSource or URLImageSource or FileImageSource`

        - `cache_control: optional CacheControlEphemeral or null`

          Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

        - `transformations: optional ImageTransformationsParam or null`

          Configures the transformations the server applies to this image before the model observes it. Each key names a condition the server transforms images for; its value selects the transformation applied. Omitted keys keep their default behavior, and an empty object is equivalent to omitting the field.

          - `oversized_image: optional "downsize" or "error"`

            What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

            - `"downsize"`

            - `"error"`

        - `type: "thinking"`

        - `signature: string`

          The `signature` value of this thinking block, exactly as returned by the API in a previous response. Used to verify that the block was generated by Claude.

          Thinking blocks must be passed back unmodified and in their original order; a modified block results in a 400 `invalid_request_error`.

        - `thinking: string`

          The `thinking` text of this block as returned by the API.

      - `RedactedThinkingBlockParam object`

        - `data: string`

          The `data` value of this redacted thinking block, exactly as returned by the API in a previous response. Opaque and encrypted; pass it back unchanged.

      - `ToolUseBlockParam object`

          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$

            - `BrowserStateBlockParam object`

              The caller's browser state after a browser toolset member call —
              the full inventory of open tabs, which tab is active, and any side
              effects (tabs opened, download state changes) the call produced.

              At most one per `tool_result`, only on a non-error result answering a
              browser toolset member `tool_use`. The server renders the
              model-visible text from it; the model never sees the raw fields.

              - `type: "browser_state"`

              - `tabs: array of BrowserStateTabEntry`

                All tabs open in the browser after this call — the full inventory, not a delta. May be empty. Whenever non-empty, exactly one entry carries `active: true`.

                maxItems: 100

                - `tab_id: string`

                  The caller-assigned identifier for this tab, unique within the inventory.

                  maxLength: 4096, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                - `title: string`

                  The title of the page the tab is showing. May be empty.

                  maxLength: 4096, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                - `url: string`

                  The URL of the page the tab is showing. May be empty.

                  maxLength: 4096, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                - `active: optional boolean`

                  Whether this tab is the active tab after this call. Whenever `tabs` is non-empty, exactly one entry is marked `active: true`.

              - `cache_control: optional CacheControlEphemeral or null`

                Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

              - `state_changes: optional array of BrowserStateChange or null`

                Tabs opened and download state changes during this call. "Nothing to report" is expressed by omitting the field, never by an empty list.

                maxItems: 200, minItems: 1

                - `BrowserStateChangeTabOpened object`

                  A tab this call's execution opened that remains open at its end —
                  the creation delta of the `tabs` inventory, not an event log.

                  Carries only the `tab_id`; the tab's `title` and `url` live on its
                  `tabs` entry, which must include the same `tab_id`. A tab opened
                  during a failed call gets no deferred `tab_opened`; it simply appears
                  in the next result's `tabs` inventory.

                  - `type: "tab_opened"`

                  - `tab_id: string`

                    The `tab_id` of the opened tab, present in `tabs`.

                    maxLength: 4096, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                - `BrowserStateChangeDownloadStarted object`

                  A file download that started during this call.

                  - `type: "download_started"`

                  - `download_id: string`

                    The caller-assigned identifier for this download, stable across the state changes reporting it.

                    maxLength: 4096, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                  - `url: string`

                    The final post-redirect URL the download was served from.

                    maxLength: 4096, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                - `BrowserStateChangeDownloadCompleted object`

                  A file download that finished during this call, reported with the
                  same `download_id` as its `download_started` — or without a prior
                  `download_started`, when the download finished during the call that
                  started it (at most one state change per `download_id` per result).

                  - `type: "download_completed"`

                  - `download_id: string`

                    The caller-assigned identifier for this download, stable across the state changes reporting it.

                    maxLength: 4096, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                  - `url: string`

                    The final post-redirect URL the download was served from.

                    maxLength: 4096, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

    - `type: "any"`

    - `disable_parallel_tool_use: optional boolean`

      Whether to disable parallel tool use.

      Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the model will output exactly one tool use.

  - `ToolChoiceTool object`

    The model will use the specified tool with `tool_choice.name`.

    - `type: "tool"`

    - `name: string`

      The name of the tool to use.

    - `disable_parallel_tool_use: optional boolean`

      Whether to disable parallel tool use.

      Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the model will output exactly one tool use.

  - `ToolChoiceNone object`

    The model will not be allowed to use tools.

    - `type: "none"`

- `tools: optional array of ToolUnion`

  Definitions of tools that the model may use.

  If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

  There are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described below applies to client tools. For [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools), see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the [web search tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).

  Each tool definition includes:

  * `name`: Name of the tool.
  * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
  * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

  For example, if you defined `tools` as:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "ticker": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
          }
        },
        "required": ["ticker"]
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

  And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
    }
  ]
  ```

  You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
      "content": "259.75 USD"
    }
  ]
  ```

  Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

  See our [guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) for more details.

  - `Tool object`

    - `type: optional "custom" or null`

    - `input_schema: object`

      [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for this tool's input.

      This defines the shape of the `input` that your tool accepts and that the model will produce.

      - `type: "object"`

      - `properties: optional map[unknown] or null`

      - `required: optional array of string or null`

    - `name: string`

      Name of the tool.

      This is how the tool will be called by the model and in `tool_use` blocks.

      maxLength: 128, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,128}$

    - `allowed_callers: optional array of "direct" or "code_execution_20250825" or "code_execution_20260120" or "code_execution_20260521"`

    - `defer_loading: optional boolean`

      If true, tool will not be included in initial system prompt. Only loaded when returned via tool_reference from tool search.

    - `description: optional string`

      Description of what this tool does.

      Tool descriptions should be as detailed as possible. The more information that the model has about what the tool is and how to use it, the better it will perform. You can use natural language descriptions to reinforce important aspects of the tool input JSON schema.

    - `eager_input_streaming: optional boolean or null`

      Enable eager input streaming for this tool. When true, tool input parameters will be streamed incrementally as they are generated, and types will be inferred on-the-fly rather than buffering the full JSON output. When false, streaming is disabled for this tool even if the fine-grained-tool-streaming beta is active. When null (default), uses the default behavior based on beta headers.

- `temperature: optional number`

  **Deprecated**: Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not support setting temperature. A value of 1.0 of will be accepted for backwards compatibility, all other values will be rejected with a 400 error.

  Amount of randomness injected into the response.

  Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

  Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

  maximum: 1, minimum: 0

- `top_k: optional number`

  **Deprecated**: Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not accept top_k; any value will be rejected with a 400 error.

  Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

  Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

  Recommended for advanced use cases only.

  minimum: 0

- `top_p: optional number`

  **Deprecated**: Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not support setting top_p. A value >= 0.99 will be accepted for backwards compatibility, all other values will be rejected with a 400 error.

  Use nucleus sampling.

  In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`.

  Recommended for advanced use cases only.

  maximum: 1, minimum: 0

### Returns

- `Message object`

  - `type: "message"`

    Object type.

    For Messages, this is always `"message"`.

    default: message

  - `id: string`

    Unique object identifier.

    The format and length of IDs may change over time.

  - `container: Container or null`

    Information about the container used in the request (for the code execution tool)

    - `id: string`

      Identifier for the container used in this request

    - `expires_at: string`

      The time at which the container will expire.

      format: date-time

    - `skills: array of ContainerSkill or null`

      Skills loaded in the container

      - `type: "anthropic" or "custom"`

        Type of skill - either 'anthropic' (built-in) or 'custom' (user-defined)

        - `"anthropic"`

        - `"custom"`

      - `skill_id: string`

        Skill ID

        maxLength: 64, minLength: 1

      - `version: string`

        The resolved version: a skill version ID for custom skills.

        maxLength: 64, minLength: 1

  - `content: array of ContentBlock`

    Content generated by the model.

    This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a `type` that determines its shape.

    Example:

    ```json
    [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
    ```

    If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

    For example, if the input `messages` were:

    ```json
    [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
    ]

    Then the response `content` might be:

    ```json
    [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]
    ```

        The request could enable cyber harm, such as malware or exploit development. Benign cybersecurity work can also trigger this category.

      - `"bio"`

        The request could enable biological harm, such as dangerous lab methods. Beneficial life sciences work can also trigger this category.

      - `"frontier_llm"`

        The request could assist the development of competing AI models, which is restricted under [Anthropic's commercial terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms). Benign machine learning work can also trigger this category.

      - `"reasoning_extraction"`

        The request asks the model to reproduce its internal reasoning in the response text. To get reasoning in a structured form instead, use [adaptive thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking).

      - `"general_harms"`

        The request could be related to an area that was determined as harmful. Benign work might sometimes trigger this category.

    The reason that we stopped.

    This may be one the following values:

    * `"end_turn"`: the model reached a natural stopping point
    * `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded the requested `max_tokens` or the model's maximum
    * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom `stop_sequences` was generated
    * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools
    * `"pause_turn"`: we paused a long-running turn. You may provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let the model continue.
    * `"refusal"`: when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations
    * `"model_context_window_exceeded"`: we exceeded the model's context window

    In non-streaming mode this value is always non-null. In streaming mode, it is null in the `message_start` event and non-null otherwise.

    This value will be a non-null string if one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

  - `usage: Usage`

    Billing and rate-limit usage.

    Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

    Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

    For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

    Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

    - `cache_creation: CacheCreation or null`

      Breakdown of cached tokens by TTL

      - `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens: number`

      The number of output tokens which were used.

      minimum: 0

    - `output_tokens_details: OutputTokensDetails or null`

      Breakdown of output tokens by category.

      `output_tokens` remains the inclusive, authoritative total used for billing.
      This object provides a read-only decomposition for observability — for example,
      how many of the billed output tokens were spent on internal reasoning that may
      have been summarized before being returned to you.

      - `thinking_tokens: number`

        Number of output tokens the model generated as internal reasoning, including
        the thinking-block delimiter tokens.

        Reflects the raw reasoning the model produced, not the (possibly shorter)
        summarized thinking text returned in the response body. Computed by
        re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
        generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
        `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

        default: 0, minimum: 0

    - `server_tool_use: ServerToolUsage or null`

      The number of server tool requests.

      - `web_fetch_requests: number`

## Count tokens in a Message

**POST** `/v1/messages/count_tokens`

Count the number of tokens in a Message.

The Token Count API can be used to count the number of tokens in a Message, including tools, images, and documents, without creating it.

Learn more about token counting in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting)

### Headers

- `"anthropic-user-profile-id": optional string`

  The user profile ID to attribute this request to. Use when acting on behalf of a party other than your organization. Requires the `user-profiles` beta header.

- `"anthropic-workspace-id": optional string`

### Body parameters

- `messages: array of MessageParam`

  Input messages.

  Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

  Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

  If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

  Example with a single `user` message:

  ```json
  [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
  ```

  Example with multiple conversational turns:

  ```json
  [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
  ]
  ```

  Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

  ```json
  [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
  ]
  ```

  Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

  ```json
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
  ```

  ```json
  {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
  ```

  See [input examples](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages).

  Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#give-claude-a-role), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

  There is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request.

            - `5m`: 5 minutes
            - `1h`: 1 hour

            Defaults to `5m`. See [prompt caching pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) for details.

            - `"5m"`

            - `"1h"`

            - `cited_text: string`

              The full text of the cited block range, concatenated.

              Always equals the contents of `content[start_block_index:end_block_index]` joined together. The text block is the minimal citable unit; this field is never a substring of a single block. Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

              minimum: 0

            - `document_title: string or null`

            - `end_block_index: number`

              Exclusive 0-based end index of the cited block range in the source's `content` array.

              Always greater than `start_block_index`; a single-block citation has `end_block_index = start_block_index + 1`.

            - `start_block_index: number`

              0-based index of the first cited block in the source's `content` array.

              minimum: 0

          - `CitationWebSearchResultLocationParam object`

          - `CitationSearchResultLocationParam object`

            - `type: "search_result_location"`

            - `cited_text: string`

              The full text of the cited block range, concatenated.

              Always equals the contents of `content[start_block_index:end_block_index]` joined together. The text block is the minimal citable unit; this field is never a substring of a single block. Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

            - `end_block_index: number`

              Exclusive 0-based end index of the cited block range in the source's `content` array.

              Always greater than `start_block_index`; a single-block citation has `end_block_index = start_block_index + 1`.

            - `search_result_index: number`

              0-based index of the cited search result among all `search_result` content blocks in the request, in the order they appear across messages and tool results.

              Counted separately from `document_index`; server-side web search results are not included in this count.

              minimum: 0

            - `source: string`

            - `start_block_index: number`

              0-based index of the first cited block in the source's `content` array.

              minimum: 0

            - `title: string or null`

      - `ImageBlockParam object`

        - `type: "image"`

        - `source: Base64ImageSource or URLImageSource or FileImageSource`

          - `Base64ImageSource object`

        - `cache_control: optional CacheControlEphemeral or null`

          Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

        - `transformations: optional ImageTransformationsParam or null`

          Configures the transformations the server applies to this image before the model observes it. Each key names a condition the server transforms images for; its value selects the transformation applied. Omitted keys keep their default behavior, and an empty object is equivalent to omitting the field.

          - `oversized_image: optional "downsize" or "error"`

            What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

            - `"downsize"`

            - `"error"`

      - `DocumentBlockParam object`

            Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

          - `citations: optional array of TextCitationParam or null`

        - `source: string`

        - `title: string`

        - `cache_control: optional CacheControlEphemeral or null`

          Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

        - `citations: optional CitationsConfigParam`

      - `ThinkingBlockParam object`

        - `type: "thinking"`

        - `signature: string`

          The `signature` value of this thinking block, exactly as returned by the API in a previous response. Used to verify that the block was generated by Claude.

          Thinking blocks must be passed back unmodified and in their original order; a modified block results in a 400 `invalid_request_error`.

        - `thinking: string`

          The `thinking` text of this block as returned by the API.

      - `RedactedThinkingBlockParam object`

        - `type: "redacted_thinking"`

        - `data: string`

          The `data` value of this redacted thinking block, exactly as returned by the API in a previous response. Opaque and encrypted; pass it back unchanged.

      - `ToolUseBlockParam object`

        - `type: "tool_use"`

        - `id: string`

          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$

        - `caller: optional DirectCaller or ServerToolCaller or ServerToolCaller20260120`

          Tool invocation directly from the model.

                Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

            - `BrowserStateBlockParam object`

              The caller's browser state after a browser toolset member call —
              the full inventory of open tabs, which tab is active, and any side
              effects (tabs opened, download state changes) the call produced.

              At most one per `tool_result`, only on a non-error result answering a
              browser toolset member `tool_use`. The server renders the
              model-visible text from it; the model never sees the raw fields.

              - `type: "browser_state"`

              - `tabs: array of BrowserStateTabEntry`

                All tabs open in the browser after this call — the full inventory, not a delta. May be empty. Whenever non-empty, exactly one entry carries `active: true`.

                maxItems: 100

                - `tab_id: string`

                  The caller-assigned identifier for this tab, unique within the inventory.

                  maxLength: 4096, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                - `title: string`

                  The title of the page the tab is showing. May be empty.

                  maxLength: 4096, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                - `url: string`

                  The URL of the page the tab is showing. May be empty.

                  maxLength: 4096, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                - `active: optional boolean`

                  Whether this tab is the active tab after this call. Whenever `tabs` is non-empty, exactly one entry is marked `active: true`.

              - `cache_control: optional CacheControlEphemeral or null`

                Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

              - `state_changes: optional array of BrowserStateChange or null`

                Tabs opened and download state changes during this call. "Nothing to report" is expressed by omitting the field, never by an empty list.

                maxItems: 200, minItems: 1

                - `BrowserStateChangeTabOpened object`

                  A tab this call's execution opened that remains open at its end —
                  the creation delta of the `tabs` inventory, not an event log.

                  Carries only the `tab_id`; the tab's `title` and `url` live on its
                  `tabs` entry, which must include the same `tab_id`. A tab opened
                  during a failed call gets no deferred `tab_opened`; it simply appears
                  in the next result's `tabs` inventory.

                  - `type: "tab_opened"`

                  - `tab_id: string`

                    The `tab_id` of the opened tab, present in `tabs`.

                    maxLength: 4096, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

                - `BrowserStateChangeDownloadStarted object`

                  A file download that started during this call.

                  - `type: "download_started"`

                  - `download_id: string`

                    The caller-assigned identifier for this download, stable across the state changes reporting it.

                    maxLength: 4096, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

      Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the model will output exactly one tool use.

  - `ToolChoiceNone object`

    The model will not be allowed to use tools.

    - `type: "none"`

- `tools: optional array of MessageCountTokensTool`

  Definitions of tools that the model may use.

  If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

  There are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described below applies to client tools. For [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools), see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the [web search tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).

  Each tool definition includes:

  * `name`: Name of the tool.
  * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
  * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

  For example, if you defined `tools` as:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "ticker": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
          }
        },
        "required": ["ticker"]
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

  And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
    }
  ]
  ```

  You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
      "content": "259.75 USD"
    }
  ]
  ```

  Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

  See our [guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) for more details.

  - `Tool object`

    - `type: optional "custom" or null`

    - `input_schema: object`

      [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for this tool's input.

      This defines the shape of the `input` that your tool accepts and that the model will produce.

      - `type: "object"`

      - `properties: optional map[unknown] or null`

      - `required: optional array of string or null`

    - `name: string`

      Name of the tool.

      This is how the tool will be called by the model and in `tool_use` blocks.

      maxLength: 128, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,128}$

    - `allowed_callers: optional array of "direct" or "code_execution_20250825" or "code_execution_20260120" or "code_execution_20260521"`

    - `defer_loading: optional boolean`

      If true, tool will not be included in initial system prompt. Only loaded when returned via tool_reference from tool search.

    - `description: optional string`

      Description of what this tool does.

      Tool descriptions should be as detailed as possible. The more information that the model has about what the tool is and how to use it, the better it will perform. You can use natural language descriptions to reinforce important aspects of the tool input JSON schema.

    - `eager_input_streaming: optional boolean or null`

      Enable eager input streaming for this tool. When true, tool input parameters will be streamed incrementally as they are generated, and types will be inferred on-the-fly rather than buffering the full JSON output. When false, streaming is disabled for this tool even if the fine-grained-tool-streaming beta is active. When null (default), uses the default behavior based on beta headers.

  browser toolset member `tool_use`. The server renders the
  model-visible text from it; the model never sees the raw fields.

  - `type: "browser_state"`

  - `tabs: array of BrowserStateTabEntry`

    All tabs open in the browser after this call — the full inventory, not a delta. May be empty. Whenever non-empty, exactly one entry carries `active: true`.

    maxItems: 100

    - `tab_id: string`

      The caller-assigned identifier for this tab, unique within the inventory.

      maxLength: 4096, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

    Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

    - `type: "ephemeral"`

    - `BrowserStateChangeTabOpened object`

      A tab this call's execution opened that remains open at its end —

      A file download that finished during this call, reported with the
      same `download_id` as its `download_started` — or without a prior

Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

        - `end_block_index: number`

          Exclusive 0-based end index of the cited block range in the source's `content` array.

          Always greater than `start_block_index`; a single-block citation has `end_block_index = start_block_index + 1`.

        - `search_result_index: number`

          0-based index of the cited search result among all `search_result` content blocks in the request, in the order they appear across messages and tool results.

    - `signature: string`

      A value used to verify that this thinking block was generated by Claude when it is passed back to the API.

      This is an opaque field and should not be interpreted or parsed. When passing thinking blocks back to the API (required when using tools with extended thinking), pass them back exactly as received, with this field intact.

      See [extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for details.

    - `transformations: optional ImageTransformationsParam or null`

      Configures the transformations the server applies to this image before the model observes it. Each key names a condition the server transforms images for; its value selects the transformation applied. Omitted keys keep their default behavior, and an empty object is equivalent to omitting the field.

      - `oversized_image: optional "downsize" or "error"`

        What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

        - `"downsize"`

        - `"error"`

        - `BrowserStateBlockParam object`

          The caller's browser state after a browser toolset member call —
          the full inventory of open tabs, which tab is active, and any side
          effects (tabs opened, download state changes) the call produced.

          At most one per `tool_result`, only on a non-error result answering a
          browser toolset member `tool_use`. The server renders the
          model-visible text from it; the model never sees the raw fields.

          - `type: "browser_state"`

          - `tabs: array of BrowserStateTabEntry`

            All tabs open in the browser after this call — the full inventory, not a delta. May be empty. Whenever non-empty, exactly one entry carries `active: true`.

            maxItems: 100

            - `tab_id: string`

            - `BrowserStateChangeTabOpened object`

              A tab this call's execution opened that remains open at its end —
              the creation delta of the `tabs` inventory, not an event log.

              Carries only the `tab_id`; the tab's `title` and `url` live on its
              `tabs` entry, which must include the same `tab_id`. A tab opened
              during a failed call gets no deferred `tab_opened`; it simply appears
              in the next result's `tabs` inventory.

              - `type: "tab_opened"`

              A file download that finished during this call, reported with the
              same `download_id` as its `download_started` — or without a prior
              `download_started`, when the download finished during the call that
              started it (at most one state change per `download_id` per result).

              - `type: "download_completed"`

        - `transformations: optional ImageTransformationsParam or null`

          Configures the transformations the server applies to this image before the model observes it. Each key names a condition the server transforms images for; its value selects the transformation applied. Omitted keys keep their default behavior, and an empty object is equivalent to omitting the field.

          - `oversized_image: optional "downsize" or "error"`

            What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

            - `transformations: optional ImageTransformationsParam or null`

              Configures the transformations the server applies to this image before the model observes it. Each key names a condition the server transforms images for; its value selects the transformation applied.

              - `oversized_image: optional "downsize" or "error"`

                What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

                - `"downsize"`

    Example:

    ```json
    [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
    ```

    If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

    For example, if the input `messages` were:

    ```json
    [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}

            Always equals the contents of `content[start_block_index:end_block_index]` joined together. The text block is the minimal citable unit; this field is never a substring of a single block. Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

          - `document_index: number`

            minimum: 0

          - `document_title: string or null`

          - `cited_text: string`

            The full text of the cited block range, concatenated.

            Always equals the contents of `content[start_block_index:end_block_index]` joined together. The text block is the minimal citable unit; this field is never a substring of a single block. Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

          - `end_block_index: number`

            Exclusive 0-based end index of the cited block range in the source's `content` array.

      default: refusal

    - `category: "cyber" or "bio" or "frontier_llm" or 2 more or null`

      The policy category that triggered a refusal.

      - `"cyber"`

        The request could enable cyber harm, such as malware or exploit development. Benign cybersecurity work can also trigger this category.

      - `"bio"`

        The request could enable biological harm, such as dangerous lab methods. Beneficial life sciences work can also trigger this category.

      - `"frontier_llm"`

        The request could assist the development of competing AI models, which is restricted under [Anthropic's commercial terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms). Benign machine learning work can also trigger this category.

      - `"reasoning_extraction"`

        The request asks the model to reproduce its internal reasoning in the response text. To get reasoning in a structured form instead, use [adaptive thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking).

    This may be one the following values:

    * `"end_turn"`: the model reached a natural stopping point
    * `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded the requested `max_tokens` or the model's maximum
    * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom `stop_sequences` was generated
    * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools
    * `"pause_turn"`: we paused a long-running turn. You may provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let the model continue.
    * `"refusal"`: when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations
    * `"model_context_window_exceeded"`: we exceeded the model's context window

    In non-streaming mode this value is always non-null. In streaming mode, it is null in the `message_start` event and non-null otherwise.

    - `"end_turn"`

    - `"max_tokens"`

    - `"stop_sequence"`

    - `"tool_use"`

    - `"pause_turn"`

    - `"refusal"`

    - `"model_context_window_exceeded"`

    Which custom stop sequence was generated, if any.

    This value will be a non-null string if one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

  - `usage: Usage`

    Billing and rate-limit usage.

    Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

    Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

    For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

    Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

    - `cache_creation: CacheCreation or null`

      Breakdown of cached tokens by TTL

      - `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens: number`

        The number of input tokens used to create the 5 minute cache entry.

        default: 0, minimum: 0

    - `cache_creation_input_tokens: number or null`

      The number of input tokens used to create the cache entry.

      minimum: 0

    - `cache_read_input_tokens: number or null`

      The number of input tokens read from the cache.

      minimum: 0

    - `inference_geo: string or null`

      The geographic region where inference was performed for this request.

    - `input_tokens: number`

      The number of input tokens which were used.

      minimum: 0

    - `output_tokens: number`

      The number of output tokens which were used.

      minimum: 0

    - `output_tokens_details: OutputTokensDetails or null`

      Breakdown of output tokens by category.

      `output_tokens` remains the inclusive, authoritative total used for billing.
      This object provides a read-only decomposition for observability — for example,
      how many of the billed output tokens were spent on internal reasoning that may
      have been summarized before being returned to you.

      - `thinking_tokens: number`

        Number of output tokens the model generated as internal reasoning, including
        the thinking-block delimiter tokens.

        Reflects the raw reasoning the model produced, not the (possibly shorter)
        summarized thinking text returned in the response body. Computed by
        re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
        generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
        `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

        default: 0, minimum: 0

    - `server_tool_use: ServerToolUsage or null`

      The number of server tool requests.

      - `web_fetch_requests: number`

        default: 0, minimum: 0

    - `service_tier: "standard" or "priority" or "batch" or null`

      If the request used the priority, standard, or batch tier.

      - `"standard"`

      - `"priority"`

      - `"batch"`

    - `eager_input_streaming: optional boolean or null`

      Enable eager input streaming for this tool. When true, tool input parameters will be streamed incrementally as they are generated, and types will be inferred on-the-fly rather than buffering the full JSON output.

    have been summarized before being returned to you.

    - `thinking_tokens: number`

      Number of output tokens the model generated as internal reasoning, including

      re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
      generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
      `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

          Configures the transformations the server applies to this image before the model observes it. Each key names a condition the server transforms images for; its value selects the transformation applied.

            What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

              effects (tabs opened, download state changes) the call produced.

              At most one per `tool_result`, only on a non-error result answering a
              browser toolset member `tool_use`. The server renders the
              model-visible text from it; the model never sees the raw fields.

                maxItems: 100

                - `tab_id: string`

                  Carries only the `tab_id`; the tab's `title` and `url` live on its
                  `tabs` entry, which must include the same `tab_id`. A tab opened
                  during a failed call gets no deferred `tab_opened`; it simply appears

    summarized thinking text returned in the response body. Computed by
    re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
    generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
    `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

        The policy category that triggered a refusal.

        - `"cyber"`

          The request could enable cyber harm, such as malware or exploit development. Benign cybersecurity work can also trigger this category.

        - `"bio"`

          The request could enable biological harm, such as dangerous lab methods. Beneficial life sciences work can also trigger this category.

        - `"frontier_llm"`

          The request could assist the development of competing AI models, which is restricted under [Anthropic's commercial terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms). Benign machine learning work can also trigger this category.

        - `"reasoning_extraction"`

          The request asks the model to reproduce its internal reasoning in the response text. To get reasoning in a structured form instead, use [adaptive thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking).

        - `"general_harms"`

          The request could be related to an area that was determined as harmful. Benign work might sometimes trigger this category.

  - `usage: MessageDeltaUsage`

    Billing and rate-limit usage.

    Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

    Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

    For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

    Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

    - `cache_creation_input_tokens: number or null`

      The cumulative number of input tokens used to create the cache entry.

      minimum: 0

    - `cache_read_input_tokens: number or null`

      The cumulative number of input tokens read from the cache.

      minimum: 0

    - `input_tokens: number or null`

      The cumulative number of input tokens which were used.

      minimum: 0

    - `output_tokens: number`

      The cumulative number of output tokens which were used.

    - `output_tokens_details: OutputTokensDetails or null`

      Breakdown of output tokens by category.

      `output_tokens` remains the inclusive, authoritative total used for billing.
      This object provides a read-only decomposition for observability — for example,
      how many of the billed output tokens were spent on internal reasoning that may
      have been summarized before being returned to you.

      - `thinking_tokens: number`

        Number of output tokens the model generated as internal reasoning, including
        the thinking-block delimiter tokens.

        Reflects the raw reasoning the model produced, not the (possibly shorter)
        summarized thinking text returned in the response body. Computed by
        re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
        generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
        `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

        default: 0, minimum: 0

    - `server_tool_use: ServerToolUsage or null`

      The number of server tool requests.

      - `web_fetch_requests: number`

        The number of web fetch tool requests.

        default: 0, minimum: 0

      - `web_search_requests: number`

        The number of web search tool requests.

        default: 0, minimum: 0

### Raw Message Start Event

- `RawMessageStartEvent object`

  - `type: "message_start"`

    default: message_start

  - `message: Message`

    - `type: "message"`

      Object type.

      For Messages, this is always `"message"`.

      default: message

    - `id: string`

      Unique object identifier.

      The format and length of IDs may change over time.

    - `container: Container or null`

      Information about the container used in the request (for the code execution tool)

      - `id: string`

        Identifier for the container used in this request

      - `expires_at: string`

        The time at which the container will expire.

        format: date-time

      - `skills: array of ContainerSkill or null`

        Skills loaded in the container

        - `type: "anthropic" or "custom"`

          Type of skill - either 'anthropic' (built-in) or 'custom' (user-defined)

          - `"anthropic"`

          - `"custom"`

        - `skill_id: string`

          Skill ID

          maxLength: 64, minLength: 1

        - `version: string`

          The resolved version: a skill version ID for custom skills.

          maxLength: 64, minLength: 1

    - `content: array of ContentBlock`

      Content generated by the model.

      This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a `type` that determines its shape.

      Example:

      ```json
      [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
      ```

      If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

      For example, if the input `messages` were:

      ```json
      [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
      ]
      ```

      Then the response `content` might be:

      ```json
      [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]
      ```

        - `type: "text"`

          default: text

        - `citations: array of TextCitation or null`

          Citations supporting the text block.

          The type of citation returned will depend on the type of document being cited. Citing a PDF results in `page_location`, plain text results in `char_location`, and content document results in `content_block_location`.

          - `CitationCharLocation object`

            - `type: "char_location"`

              default: char_location

              The full text of the cited block range, concatenated.

              Always equals the contents of `content[start_block_index:end_block_index]` joined together. The text block is the minimal citable unit; this field is never a substring of a single block. Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

            - `document_index: number`

              minimum: 0

            - `document_title: string or null`

            - `end_block_index: number`

              Exclusive 0-based end index of the cited block range in the source's `content` array.

              Always greater than `start_block_index`; a single-block citation has `end_block_index = start_block_index + 1`.

            - `file_id: string or null`

            - `start_block_index: number`

              0-based index of the first cited block in the source's `content` array.

            - `end_block_index: number`

              Exclusive 0-based end index of the cited block range in the source's `content` array.

              Always greater than `start_block_index`; a single-block citation has `end_block_index = start_block_index + 1`.

            - `search_result_index: number`

              0-based index of the cited search result among all `search_result` content blocks in the request, in the order they appear across messages and tool results.

              Counted separately from `document_index`; server-side web search results are not included in this count.

          default: thinking

        - `signature: string`

          A value used to verify that this thinking block was generated by Claude when it is passed back to the API.

          This is an opaque field and should not be interpreted or parsed. When passing thinking blocks back to the API (required when using tools with extended thinking), pass them back exactly as received, with this field intact.

          See [extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for details.

      - `type: "refusal"`

        default: refusal

      - `category: "cyber" or "bio" or "frontier_llm" or 2 more or null`

        The policy category that triggered a refusal.

        - `"cyber"`

          The request could enable cyber harm, such as malware or exploit development. Benign cybersecurity work can also trigger this category.

        - `"bio"`

          The request could enable biological harm, such as dangerous lab methods. Beneficial life sciences work can also trigger this category.

        - `"frontier_llm"`

          The request could assist the development of competing AI models, which is restricted under [Anthropic's commercial terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms). Benign machine learning work can also trigger this category.

        - `"reasoning_extraction"`

          The request asks the model to reproduce its internal reasoning in the response text. To get reasoning in a structured form instead, use [adaptive thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking).

        - `"general_harms"`

          The request could be related to an area that was determined as harmful. Benign work might sometimes trigger this category.

      - `explanation: string or null`

        Human-readable explanation of the refusal.

        This text is not guaranteed to be stable. `null` when no explanation is available for the category.

    - `stop_reason: StopReason or null`

      The reason that we stopped.

      This may be one the following values:

      * `"end_turn"`: the model reached a natural stopping point
      * `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded the requested `max_tokens` or the model's maximum
      * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom `stop_sequences` was generated
      * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools
      * `"pause_turn"`: we paused a long-running turn. You may provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let the model continue.
      * `"refusal"`: when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations
      * `"model_context_window_exceeded"`: we exceeded the model's context window

      In non-streaming mode this value is always non-null. In streaming mode, it is null in the `message_start` event and non-null otherwise.

      - `"end_turn"`

      - `"max_tokens"`

      - `"stop_sequence"`

      - `"tool_use"`

      - `"pause_turn"`

      - `"refusal"`

      - `"model_context_window_exceeded"`

    - `stop_sequence: string or null`

      Which custom stop sequence was generated, if any.

      This value will be a non-null string if one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

    - `usage: Usage`

      Billing and rate-limit usage.

      Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

      Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

      For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

      Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

      - `cache_creation: CacheCreation or null`

        Breakdown of cached tokens by TTL

        - `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens: number`

          The number of input tokens used to create the 1 hour cache entry.

          default: 0, minimum: 0

        - `ephemeral_5m_input_tokens: number`

          The number of input tokens used to create the 5 minute cache entry.

          default: 0, minimum: 0

      - `cache_creation_input_tokens: number or null`

        The number of input tokens used to create the cache entry.

        minimum: 0

      - `cache_read_input_tokens: number or null`

        The number of input tokens read from the cache.

        minimum: 0

      - `inference_geo: string or null`

        The geographic region where inference was performed for this request.

      - `input_tokens: number`

        The number of input tokens which were used.

        minimum: 0

      - `output_tokens: number`

        The number of output tokens which were used.

        minimum: 0

      - `output_tokens_details: OutputTokensDetails or null`

        Breakdown of output tokens by category.

        `output_tokens` remains the inclusive, authoritative total used for billing.
        This object provides a read-only decomposition for observability — for example,
        how many of the billed output tokens were spent on internal reasoning that may
        have been summarized before being returned to you.

        - `thinking_tokens: number`

          Number of output tokens the model generated as internal reasoning, including
          the thinking-block delimiter tokens.

          Reflects the raw reasoning the model produced, not the (possibly shorter)
          summarized thinking text returned in the response body. Computed by
          re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
          generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
          `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

          default: 0, minimum: 0

      - `server_tool_use: ServerToolUsage or null`

        The number of server tool requests.

        - `web_fetch_requests: number`

          The number of web fetch tool requests.

          default: 0, minimum: 0

        - `web_search_requests: number`

          The number of web search tool requests.

          default: 0, minimum: 0

      - `service_tier: "standard" or "priority" or "batch" or null`

        If the request used the priority, standard, or batch tier.

        - `"standard"`

        - `"priority"`

        - `"batch"`

### Raw Message Stop Event

- `RawMessageStopEvent object`

  - `RawMessageStartEvent object`

    - `type: "message_start"`

      default: message_start

    - `message: Message`

      - `type: "message"`

        Object type.

        For Messages, this is always `"message"`.

        default: message

      - `id: string`

        Unique object identifier.

        The format and length of IDs may change over time.

      - `container: Container or null`

        Information about the container used in the request (for the code execution tool)

        - `id: string`

          Identifier for the container used in this request

        - `expires_at: string`

          The time at which the container will expire.

          format: date-time

        - `skills: array of ContainerSkill or null`

          Skills loaded in the container

          - `type: "anthropic" or "custom"`

            Type of skill - either 'anthropic' (built-in) or 'custom' (user-defined)

            - `"anthropic"`

            - `"custom"`

          - `skill_id: string`

            Skill ID

            maxLength: 64, minLength: 1

          - `version: string`

            The resolved version: a skill version ID for custom skills.

            maxLength: 64, minLength: 1

      - `content: array of ContentBlock`

        Content generated by the model.

        This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a `type` that determines its shape.

        Example:

        ```json
        [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
        ```

        If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

        For example, if the input `messages` were:

        ```json
        [
          {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
          {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
        ]
        ```

        Then the response `content` might be:

        ```json
        [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]
        ```

        - `TextBlock object`

          - `type: "text"`

            default: text

          - `citations: array of TextCitation or null`

            Citations supporting the text block.

            The type of citation returned will depend on the type of document being cited. Citing a PDF results in `page_location`, plain text results in `char_location`, and content document results in `content_block_location`.

            - `CitationCharLocation object`

              - `type: "char_location"`

            - `CitationContentBlockLocation object`

              - `type: "content_block_location"`

                default: content_block_location

              - `cited_text: string`

                The full text of the cited block range, concatenated.

                Always equals the contents of `content[start_block_index:end_block_index]` joined together. The text block is the minimal citable unit; this field is never a substring of a single block. Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

              - `document_index: number`

                minimum: 0

              - `document_title: string or null`

      - `usage: Usage`

        Billing and rate-limit usage.

        Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

        Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

        For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

        Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

        - `cache_creation: CacheCreation or null`

          Breakdown of cached tokens by TTL

          `output_tokens` remains the inclusive, authoritative total used for billing.
          This object provides a read-only decomposition for observability — for example,
          how many of the billed output tokens were spent on internal reasoning that may
          have been summarized before being returned to you.

          - `thinking_tokens: number`

            Number of output tokens the model generated as internal reasoning, including
            the thinking-block delimiter tokens.

            Reflects the raw reasoning the model produced, not the (possibly shorter)
            summarized thinking text returned in the response body. Computed by
            re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
            generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
            `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

  - `eager_input_streaming: optional boolean or null`

    Enable eager input streaming for this tool. When true, tool input parameters will be streamed incrementally as they are generated, and types will be inferred on-the-fly rather than buffering the full JSON output.

          - `oversized_image: optional "downsize" or "error"`

            What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

        the full inventory of open tabs, which tab is active, and any side
        effects (tabs opened, download state changes) the call produced.

        At most one per `tool_result`, only on a non-error result answering a
        browser toolset member `tool_use`. The server renders the
        model-visible text from it; the model never sees the raw fields.

        - `type: "browser_state"`

        - `tabs: array of BrowserStateTabEntry`

          All tabs open in the browser after this call — the full inventory, not a delta. May be empty. Whenever non-empty, exactly one entry carries `active: true`.

          maxItems: 100

          - `tab_id: string`

            The caller-assigned identifier for this tab, unique within the inventory.

            maxLength: 4096, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

          - `title: string`

            The title of the page the tab is showing. May be empty.

            maxLength: 4096, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

          - `url: string`

            The URL of the page the tab is showing. May be empty.

            maxLength: 4096, pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$

          - `active: optional boolean`

            Whether this tab is the active tab after this call. Whenever `tabs` is non-empty, exactly one entry is marked `active: true`.

        - `cache_control: optional CacheControlEphemeral or null`

          Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

        - `state_changes: optional array of BrowserStateChange or null`

          Tabs opened and download state changes during this call. "Nothing to report" is expressed by omitting the field, never by an empty list.

          maxItems: 200, minItems: 1

          - `BrowserStateChangeTabOpened object`

            A tab this call's execution opened that remains open at its end —
            the creation delta of the `tabs` inventory, not an event log.

            Carries only the `tab_id`; the tab's `title` and `url` live on its
            `tabs` entry, which must include the same `tab_id`. A tab opened
            during a failed call gets no deferred `tab_opened`; it simply appears
            in the next result's `tabs` inventory.

            - `type: "tab_opened"`

            - `tab_id: string`

              The `tab_id` of the opened tab, present in `tabs`.

          - `BrowserStateChangeDownloadCompleted object`

            A file download that finished during this call, reported with the
            same `download_id` as its `download_started` — or without a prior
            `download_started`, when the download finished during the call that
            started it (at most one state change per `download_id` per result).

            - `type: "download_completed"`

            - `download_id: string`

              The caller-assigned identifier for this download, stable across the state changes reporting it.

            - `path: optional string or null`

              Where the executor saved the file, on the executor's filesystem. Only included when another tool in the same environment can read the file at that path.

              pattern: ^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f\u2028\u2029]*$, maxLength: 4096

            - `size_bytes: optional number or null`

              minimum: 0

          - `BrowserStateChangeDownloadFailed object`

                  What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

                    Configures the transformations the server applies to this image before the model observes it. Each key names a condition the server transforms images for; its value selects the transformation applied. Omitted keys keep their default behavior, and an empty object is equivalent to omitting the field.

                      What the server does when this image exceeds the model's maximum image size. `"downsize"` (the default) scales the image down to fit, which changes the dimensions the model observes without telling you. `"error"` instead rejects the request with a 400 error naming the image's dimensions and the largest dimensions that fit, so you can scale the image deliberately — your image is never silently scaled down.

## Messages › Batches

### Create a Message Batch

**POST** `/v1/messages/batches`

Send a batch of Message creation requests.

The Message Batches API can be used to process multiple Messages API requests at once. Once a Message Batch is created, it begins processing immediately. Batches can take up to 24 hours to complete.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

#### Headers

- `"anthropic-user-profile-id": optional string`

  The user profile ID to attribute the requests in this batch to. Use when acting on behalf of a party other than your organization. Requires the `user-profiles` beta header. Applies to every request in the batch; an individual request whose `user_profile_id` body field conflicts with this header is errored.

- `"anthropic-workspace-id": optional string`

#### Body parameters

- `requests: array of object`

  List of requests for prompt completion. Each is an individual request to create a Message.

  maxItems: 100000, minItems: 1

  - `custom_id: string`

    Developer-provided ID created for each request in a Message Batch. Useful for matching results to requests, as results may be given out of request order.

    Must be unique for each request within the Message Batch.

    maxLength: 64, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$

  - `params: object`

    Messages API creation parameters for the individual request.

    See the [Messages API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages) for full documentation on available parameters.

    - `max_tokens: number`

      The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

      Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

      Set to `0` to populate the [prompt cache](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#pre-warming-the-cache) without generating a response.

      Different models have different maximum values for this parameter.  See [models](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) for details.

      minimum: 0

    - `messages: array of MessageParam`

      Input messages.

      Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

      Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

      If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

      Example with a single `user` message:

      ```json
      [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
      ```

      Example with multiple conversational turns:

      ```json
      [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
      ]
      ```

      Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

      ```json
      [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
      ]
      ```

      Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

      ```json
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
      ```

      ```json
      {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
      ```

      See [input examples](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages).

      Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#give-claude-a-role), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

      There is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request.

        - `string`

                  browser toolset member `tool_use`. The server renders the

                      Carries only the `tab_id`; the tab's `title` and `url` live on its

                      during a failed call gets no deferred `tab_opened`; it simply appears

        The model will automatically decide whether to use tools.

        - `type: "auto"`

        - `disable_parallel_tool_use: optional boolean`

          Whether to disable parallel tool use.

          Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the model will output at most one tool use.

      - `ToolChoiceAny object`

        The model will use any available tools.

        - `type: "any"`

        - `disable_parallel_tool_use: optional boolean`

          Whether to disable parallel tool use.

          Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the model will output exactly one tool use.

      - `ToolChoiceTool object`

        The model will use the specified tool with `tool_choice.name`.

        - `type: "tool"`

        - `name: string`

          The name of the tool to use.

        - `disable_parallel_tool_use: optional boolean`

          Whether to disable parallel tool use.

          Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the model will output exactly one tool use.

      - `ToolChoiceNone object`

        The model will not be allowed to use tools.

        - `type: "none"`

    - `tools: optional array of ToolUnion`

      Definitions of tools that the model may use.

      If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

      There are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described below applies to client tools. For [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools), see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the [web search tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).

      Each tool definition includes:

      * `name`: Name of the tool.
      * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
      * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

      For example, if you defined `tools` as:

      ```json
      [
        {
          "name": "get_stock_price",
          "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
          "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "ticker": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
              }
            },
            "required": ["ticker"]
          }
        }
      ]
      ```

      And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

      ```json
      [
        {
          "type": "tool_use",
          "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
          "name": "get_stock_price",
          "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
        }
      ]
      ```

      You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

      ```json
      [
        {
          "type": "tool_result",
          "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
          "content": "259.75 USD"
        }
      ]
      ```

      Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

      See our [guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) for more details.

      - `Tool object`

        - `type: optional "custom" or null`

        - `input_schema: object`

          [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for this tool's input.

          This defines the shape of the `input` that your tool accepts and that the model will produce.

          - `type: "object"`

          - `properties: optional map[unknown] or null`

          - `required: optional array of string or null`

        - `name: string`

          Name of the tool.

          This is how the tool will be called by the model and in `tool_use` blocks.

          maxLength: 128, minLength: 1, pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,128}$

        - `allowed_callers: optional array of "direct" or "code_execution_20250825" or "code_execution_20260120" or "code_execution_20260521"`

          - `"direct"`

        - `cache_control: optional CacheControlEphemeral or null`

          Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

        - `defer_loading: optional boolean`

          If true, tool will not be included in initial system prompt. Only loaded when returned via tool_reference from tool search.

        - `description: optional string`

          Description of what this tool does.

          Tool descriptions should be as detailed as possible. The more information that the model has about what the tool is and how to use it, the better it will perform. You can use natural language descriptions to reinforce important aspects of the tool input JSON schema.

        - `eager_input_streaming: optional boolean or null`

          Enable eager input streaming for this tool. When true, tool input parameters will be streamed incrementally as they are generated, and types will be inferred on-the-fly rather than buffering the full JSON output. When false, streaming is disabled for this tool even if the fine-grained-tool-streaming beta is active. When null (default), uses the default behavior based on beta headers.

        - `input_examples: optional array of map[unknown]`

        `enable_zoom` are not fields of a toolset entry — it carries only
        `type`, `configs`, and `cache_control`; zoom is controlled
        via `configs.zoom.enabled`.

### Cancel a Message Batch

**POST** `/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/cancel`

Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.

The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.

### Retrieve Message Batch results

**GET** `/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/results`

Streams the results of a Message Batch as a `.jsonl` file.

Each line in the file is a JSON object containing the result of a single request in the Message Batch. Results are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

#### Path parameters

- `message_batch_id: string`

  ID of the Message Batch.

#### Headers

- `"anthropic-workspace-id": optional string`

#### Returns

- `MessageBatchIndividualResponse object`

  This is a single line in the response `.jsonl` file and does not represent the response as a whole.

  - `custom_id: string`

    Developer-provided ID created for each request in a Message Batch. Useful for matching results to requests, as results may be given out of request order.

    Must be unique for each request within the Message Batch.

  - `result: MessageBatchResult`

    Processing result for this request.

    Contains a Message output if processing was successful, an error response if processing failed, or the reason why processing was not attempted, such as cancellation or expiration.

    - `MessageBatchSucceededResult object`

      - `type: "succeeded"`

        default: succeeded

      - `message: Message`

        - `type: "message"`

          Object type.

          For Messages, this is always `"message"`.

          default: message

        - `id: string`

          Unique object identifier.

          The format and length of IDs may change over time.

        - `container: Container or null`

          Information about the container used in the request (for the code execution tool)

          - `id: string`

            Identifier for the container used in this request

          - `expires_at: string`

            The time at which the container will expire.

            format: date-time

            Skills loaded in the container

            - `type: "anthropic" or "custom"`

              Type of skill - either 'anthropic' (built-in) or 'custom' (user-defined)

              - `"anthropic"`

              - `"custom"`

            - `skill_id: string`

              maxLength: 64, minLength: 1

        - `content: array of ContentBlock`

          Content generated by the model.

          This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a `type` that determines its shape.

          Example:

          ```json
          [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
          ```

          If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

          For example, if the input `messages` were:

          ```json
          [
            {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
          ]
          ```

          Then the response `content` might be:

          ```json
          [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]
          ```

              The type of citation returned will depend on the type of document being cited. Citing a PDF results in `page_location`, plain text results in `char_location`, and content document results in `content_block_location`.

              - `CitationCharLocation object`

                - `type: "char_location"`

The text block is the minimal citable unit; this field is never a substring of a single block. Not counted toward output tokens, and not counted toward input tokens when sent back in subsequent turns.

                - `document_index: number`

                  minimum: 0

                - `document_title: string or null`

                - `end_block_index: number`

                  Exclusive 0-based end index of the cited block range in the source's `content` array.

                  Always greater than `start_block_index`; a single-block citation has `end_block_index = start_block_index + 1`.

                - `file_id: string or null`

                - `start_block_index: number`

                  0-based index of the first cited block in the source's `content` array.

          - `string`

        - `role: "assistant"`

          Conversational role of the generated message.

          This will always be `"assistant"`.

          default: assistant

        - `stop_details: RefusalStopDetails or null`

          Structured information about a refusal.

          - `type: "refusal"`

            default: refusal

          - `category: "cyber" or "bio" or "frontier_llm" or 2 more or null`

            The policy category that triggered a refusal.

            - `"cyber"`

              The request could enable cyber harm, such as malware or exploit development. Benign cybersecurity work can also trigger this category.

            - `"bio"`

              The request could enable biological harm, such as dangerous lab methods. Beneficial life sciences work can also trigger this category.

            - `"frontier_llm"`

              The request could assist the development of competing AI models, which is restricted under [Anthropic's commercial terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms). Benign machine learning work can also trigger this category.

            - `"reasoning_extraction"`

              The request asks the model to reproduce its internal reasoning in the response text. To get reasoning in a structured form instead, use [adaptive thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking).

            - `"general_harms"`

              The request could be related to an area that was determined as harmful. Benign work might sometimes trigger this category.

          - `explanation: string or null`

            Human-readable explanation of the refusal.

            This text is not guaranteed to be stable. `null` when no explanation is available for the category.

        - `stop_reason: StopReason or null`

          The reason that we stopped.

          This may be one the following values:

          * `"end_turn"`: the model reached a natural stopping point
          * `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded the requested `max_tokens` or the model's maximum
          * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom `stop_sequences` was generated
          * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools
          * `"pause_turn"`: we paused a long-running turn. You may provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let the model continue.
          * `"refusal"`: when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations
          * `"model_context_window_exceeded"`: we exceeded the model's context window

          In non-streaming mode this value is always non-null. In streaming mode, it is null in the `message_start` event and non-null otherwise.

          - `"end_turn"`

          - `"max_tokens"`

          - `"stop_sequence"`

          - `"tool_use"`

          - `"pause_turn"`

          - `"refusal"`

          - `"model_context_window_exceeded"`

        - `stop_sequence: string or null`

          Which custom stop sequence was generated, if any.

          This value will be a non-null string if one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

        - `usage: Usage`

          Billing and rate-limit usage.

          Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

          Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

          For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

          Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

          - `cache_creation: CacheCreation or null`

            Breakdown of cached tokens by TTL

            - `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens: number`

              The number of input tokens used to create the 1 hour cache entry.

              default: 0, minimum: 0

            - `ephemeral_5m_input_tokens: number`

              The number of input tokens used to create the 5 minute cache entry.

              default: 0, minimum: 0

          - `cache_creation_input_tokens: number or null`

            The number of input tokens used to create the cache entry.

            minimum: 0

          - `cache_read_input_tokens: number or null`

            The number of input tokens read from the cache.

            minimum: 0

          - `inference_geo: string or null`

            The geographic region where inference was performed for this request.

          - `input_tokens: number`

            The number of input tokens which were used.

            minimum: 0

          - `output_tokens: number`

            The number of output tokens which were used.

            minimum: 0

          - `output_tokens_details: OutputTokensDetails or null`

            Breakdown of output tokens by category.

            `output_tokens` remains the inclusive, authoritative total used for billing.
            This object provides a read-only decomposition for observability — for example,
            how many of the billed output tokens were spent on internal reasoning that may
            have been summarized before being returned to you.

            - `thinking_tokens: number`

              Number of output tokens the model generated as internal reasoning, including
              the thinking-block delimiter tokens.

              Reflects the raw reasoning the model produced, not the (possibly shorter)
              summarized thinking text returned in the response body. Computed by
              re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
              generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
              `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

              default: 0, minimum: 0

          - `server_tool_use: ServerToolUsage or null`

            The number of server tool requests.

              The number of web search tool requests.

              default: 0, minimum: 0

          - `service_tier: "standard" or "priority" or "batch" or null`

            If the request used the priority, standard, or batch tier.
